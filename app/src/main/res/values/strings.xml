        \n\nI love dolphins.
        \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
        \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        \n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
        \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
        \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n

    <string name="bio_binding">Hi, this Fragment is using view binding!
        \n\nBinding is very useful.
        \n\nView binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
        \nOnce view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module.
        \nAn instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.
        \n\nIn most cases, view binding replaces findViewById.
        \n\nYou should try using it too.\n\n
